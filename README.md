# Github Search Repository App

I have made a simple yet useful app which is a Github search repository app \
where we can search a Github user with his/her username and it will display \
the public repositories available. We can also filter the displayed \
repositories with it's name or the programming language that is used.

# Getting Started with the Github Search Repository app
Once cloned make sure that you have Node installed

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
